        <h3>First Job</h3>
        <span class="exp-date">Mac 2023 - Oct 2023</span>
        <p><i class='bx bx-like'></i>I had my first job experience after completing Form 6. It marked the beginning of my working journey and made me feel excited and proud of myself. Since the age of 17, I rarely went out except for school programs. As my family is quite strict, I had to inform them wherever I went, and I was not very social. So, getting a job gave me the confidence to try new things.</p>

        <p><i class='bx bx-like'></i>I worked at a souvenir shop in my village, which was a popular spot for tourists. At first, I was nervous because I wasn’t used to speaking to strangers, but over time, I became more confident. There was even a customer who complimented my polite and fluent way of speaking. I worked sincerely because I enjoyed the job, and my employer was very kind and understanding. He even appreciated my efforts by gifting me a phone, which I still use to this day.</p>

        <p><i class='bx bx-like'></i>However, I also learned that working is not easy. I had to manage my emotions well, especially when dealing with different types of customers like schoolchildren and older ladies. I worked alone and had to handle all the tasks by myself. This experience has helped boost my confidence in life.</p>

        <h3>Second Job</h3>
        <span class="">2023</span>
        <p><i class='bx bx-like'></i>My second job experience was at a food stall. Although I only worked there for a short period, it was a big challenge as it involved dealing with various types of people. On my first day, I was extremely nervous because I had to be in the kitchen area, but luckily my tasks were only to make drinks and take orders.</p>

        <p><i class='bx bx-like'></i>One day, I mistakenly prepared the wrong drink — the customer ordered black coffee (kopi O), but I accidentally made milk coffee. This caused the customer to become angry, and I had to ask a colleague to handle it. It was my first time preparing drinks for people outside of my own family.</p>

        <p><i class='bx bx-like'></i>In addition, this job required me to be physically active — taking orders, cleaning tables, and washing utensils. It made me physically and emotionally exhausted, especially when dealing with rude or demanding customers. However, I tried my best to stay positive.</p> 

        <p><i class='bx bx-like'></i>Although this job was stressful and less enjoyable compared to my first job, which was calm and pleasant, it taught me that not everyone will appreciate our kindness. We should not expect anything in return from others. This job helped me grow up because I was surrounded by adults and learned a lot about life.</p>

        <p><i class='bx bx-like'></i>This experience is very meaningful and has become a motivation in my life — not every job is easy, but every challenge shapes me to become a stronger person.</p>
